# Lune
An Advantage. Lune skin for Artificer

I just finished Expedition 33 this week and can't take it out of my mind, so here I am making skins for risk of rain. Lune fits so perfectly with Artificer, so I had to make her first. I'm also planning to update my music mod with some of the tracks in Expedition 33 ost.
